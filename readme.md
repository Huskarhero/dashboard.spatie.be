This repo contains the source code of our dashboard.

## Example

<img style="max-width:100%; height: auto" src="http://spatie.github.io/dashboard.spatie.be/images/screenshot20181118.png">

Our configured dashboard has following tiles:

- Twitter stream with all tweets mentioning and quoting [@spatie_be](https://twitter.com/spatie_be)
- Clock/date/weather
- Team tile with todo's via GitHub files, remote status via Slack, current tracks via [Last.fm](https://last.fm)
- [Packagist](https://packagist.org) downloads
- Internet up/down via WebSockets
- [Velo](https://www.velo-antwerpen.be/en) status

## How it works

Our own [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) gave a talk on the dashboard at Laracon EU where he explained how the dashboard works behind the screens. The talk was recorded and published [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtB_rTh61Zo).

## Installation

Install this package by running cloning this repository and install like you normally install Laravel.

- Run `composer install` and `npm install yarn`
- Run `yarn` and `yarn run dev` to generate assets
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your values (`php artisan key:generate`, database, pusher values etc)
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed`, this will seed a user based on your `BASIC_AUTH` `.env` values
- Start your queue listener and setup the Laravel scheduler.
- Open the dashboard in your browser, login and wait for the update events to fill the dashboard.

## Postcardware
